Intro + roadmap

securityknowledgeframework.com is up and running again!
+ 
new updates!

My name is Riccardo ten Cate and i am a penetration tester at Kingsafe.

My experience taught me that the current level of security the current web-applications contain is not sufficient
enough to ensure security.

This is mainly because web-developers simpy aren't aware of the risks and dangers are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers.

Because of this i decided to develop a proof of concept framework in order to create a guide system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design.

The security knowledge framework is here to support developers create secure applications.

By analysing proccessing techniques in which the developers use to edit their data the application can link these techniques to different known vulnerabilities and give the developer feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these techniques in a safe manner.

The seccond stage of the application is validating if the developer properly implemented different types of 
defense mechanisms such as by example:

Do sessions contain the httpOnly flag?

By means of the answers supplied by the developer the application again generates documentation in which it gives
feedback on what defense mechanisms he forgot to implement and give him feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly implement these techniques in a safe manner.

Note: The application is running on an raspberry pi, because of this it could sometimes take a little longer to              generate results or pages when being visited by multiple users.
