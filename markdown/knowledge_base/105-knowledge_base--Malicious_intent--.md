Malicious intent
-------

**Description:**
Before pushing a code live you should check the software for malicious code in order to make sure no developers with evil intent made backdoors or deliberately put in exploits.


**Solution:**
Running your code through a static code analyser or auditing tools could give you a change to find malicious peaces of code which could be embedded into the software. Also if possible always check manually in order to prevent false negatives.
