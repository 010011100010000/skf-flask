Content type headers
-------

**Description:**
This reduces exposure to drive-by download attacks and sites serving user uploaded content that, by clever naming, could be treated by MSIE as executable or dynamic HTML files.


**Solution:**
An example of a content type header would be - Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
