Input rejection
-------

**Description:**
Whenever the application detects malicious or unexpected userinput you want to make sure the application actual rejects the submitted userinput. Rather than accept or reject input. Another option is to change the user input into an acceptable format


**Solution:**
Verify that the application actual rejects, sanitise or format your userinput into not malicious data. If not the application should return/die.
