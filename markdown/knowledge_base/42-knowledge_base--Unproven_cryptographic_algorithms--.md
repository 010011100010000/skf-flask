Unproven cryptographic algorithms
-------

**Description:**

The encryption techniques used in the application must be known and proven methods. When there is a self-made hashing algorithm developed it is very likely to contain vulnerabilities due to math-flaws resulting in encryption which can be broken


**Solution:**

Never implement your own Cypto or design yourself Crypto functions. Let an expert do this!
