# Authentication integrety checks 
-------

## Description:

Whenever security logs can be modified by unauthorized users, potential attackers could use these
privileges to erase their attacks against the appliation or simply soil the log files.

## Solution:

From PCI:

"10.5.5 Use file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs  to ensure that existing 
log data cannot be changed without generating alerts (although new data being added should not cause an alert). "
