About security knowledge framework
------------------------------------
Our experience taught us that the current level of security the current 
web-applications contain is not sufficient enough to ensure security. 
This is mainly because web-developers simpy aren't aware of the risks and dangers 
which are lurking, waiting to be exploited by hackers. 

Because of this we decided to develop a proof of concept framework in order 
to create a guide system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design.

The security knowledge framework is here to support developers create secure applications. 
By analysing proccessing techniques in which the developers use to edit their 
data the application can link these techniques to different known vulnerabilities and 
give the developer feedback regarding descriptions and solutions on how to properly 
implement these techniques in a safe manner. 

The seccond stage of the application is validating if the developer 
properly implemented different types of defense mechanisms by means of checklists 
with among others the OWASP Application security verification standards.

By means of the answers supplied by the developer the application again generates
documentation in which it gives feedback on what defense mechanisms the developer forgot to 
implement and give him feedback regarding descriptions and solutions 
on how to properly implement these techniques in a safe manner.
