Install:

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install sqlite3

sudo pip install https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tarball/master
sudo pip install markdown
sudo pip install BeautifulSoup
sudo pip install python-docx

1. initialize the database with this command:

     flask --app=skf initdb

2. now you can run skf from the skf dir:

     python skf.py

     the application will greet you on
     https://127.0.0.1:5443/

     Default the application will generate a certificate on the fly but what you 
     really want to do is placing your own server.key and server.crt in the skf dir. 
     Then the skf-flask application will use these instead.

	 default username: admin
	 password is auto generated for each time the skf-application is launched. 
	 Check the cmd output for the password.
